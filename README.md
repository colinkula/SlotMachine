# Slot Machine Simulation

## Description
This project is a simple Python-based slot machine simulation that aims to replicate the experience of playing a basic slot machine game. The code emphasizes readability and uses fundamental programming concepts. Key features include random number generation, user input handling, basic data structures, and a straightforward game flow.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation:** Utilizes the `random` module for generating random outcomes in the slot machine spin.
  
- **User Input Handling:** Ensures users provide valid input for deposit, the number of lines, and the bet amount.
  
- **Data Structures:** Uses dictionaries for symbol counts and values to organize game-related data.
  
- **Control Flow:** Implements loops and conditional statements for game flow, including the main game loop.
  
- **Functions:** Utilizes modular functions like `check_winnings`, `get_spin`, and `print_spin` for specific functionalities.
  
- **Simulation:** Simulates a basic slot machine game, providing hands-on experience in creating a simple simulation.
  
- **Error Handling:** Implements basic error handling to ensure valid user input.

## Usage
To run the slot machine program, execute the `main()` function. The program prompts the user to deposit an initial amount, provides an interface to spin the slot machine, and displays the outcomes. Users can continue playing or exit the game by pressing 'q'.
